## 📂 My Projects
- [Credit Risk Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/akabzw24/Credit-Risk-Prediction-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Model)  
Built and compared supervised learning models to predict credit card default using imbalanced financial data. Applied SMOTE oversampling and model evaluation metrics to enhance predictive performance and support risk assessment strategies.
- [Urban System Revenue Prediction with XGBoost (DSMLC Competition)](https://github.com/akabzw24/Urban-revenue-prediction-XGBoost)  
Applied XGBoost regression modelling to predict municipal revenue in urban systems using infrastructure investment data. Feature engineering, log transformation, and model tuning achieved high predictive accuracy.
- [Quantify Energy Risk Case Competition 2025](https://github.com/akabzw24/quantify-energy-risk-case-2025)  
Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict high-loss CAT events. Created an interactive Power BI dashboard with parametric triggers and strategic recommendations for renewable expansion.
- [Demographic Trends and Housing Analysis in Calgary (Capstone Project)](https://github.com/akabzw24/Demographic-Trends-and-Housing-Analysis-in-Calgary)
Conducted regression analysis on Calgary's housing supply and population growth using historical census and building permit data. Identified key factors influencing demographic shifts and housing demands to inform urban planning strategies.
- [Detecting COVID-19 Health Misinformation Targeting Older Adults](https://github.com/akabzw24/covid-misinfo-nlp)  
Developed and compared TF–IDF + Logistic Regression and fine-tuned BERT classifiers on COVID-19 tweets, evaluated cross-platform robustness on senior-focused Reddit posts, applied SHAP for interpretability, and used LDA topic modelling to uncover key misinformation themes.
